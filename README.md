# elm-static
A Static Site Generator in Elm






# Desired Features

 * _Typesafe URLs_ - Meaning links are either provided as a type for local urls, and external urls are flagged as such.
   * This allows checking of url validity.  External urls can be GET'ed on build to ensure that they actually exist

 * _Typechecked Models/Content_ - If content is missing a necessary field, it should give a build error

 * _Integration with existing HTML/CSS_ -  

 * _Content be written in markdown_ - 

 * _Potential means for plugins?_ - Simple example would be google analytics.
